				<h4>Talk me through your career prior to Betsson</h4>
				<p>I started my own company when I was 21 in construction in Sweden. I sold glass windows and grew my company over the years to 15 employees. I decided I wanted a new challenge so I came to Betsson after 8 years of being my own boss.</p>
				<h4>Why did you move to join Betsson?</h4>
				<p>I wanted to be in a stable and organised company. I wanted stability, structure and to work in a big organisation. I started as an agent here, I knew that Betsson was hiring as I had friends here. I stayed here in Malta for a month before applying for the job and once I applied it was a quick and efficient process with me having a job within a few days. My first impression of Betsson was of my manager Aleksej, he helped me a lot and that alone made me want to stay â€“ he is an awesome manager. I started in November last year, it took some time to settle into the number of chats etc. but I was given time to settle and feedback so I could excel.</p>

				<figure id="attachment_47" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-47 size-medium" src="https://source.unsplash.com/460x531/?casino" alt="test" ><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">NAMENAME LASTNAME</figcaption></figure>
				<h4>Why did you want to become a Team Leader?</h4>
				<p>I have always been in a managerial position; I am really comfortable in the role. I am happy that the energy I put into the company really helps with a lot of young people to make them excel. Finding people who want to excel and helping them do that is what I want to do.</p>

				<h4>How does your average day look?</h4>
				<p>There is a lot of planning of my day. I need to make sure everyone is here and that contacts are being handled properly and according to the procedure. I engage with my team and send feedback to agents where needed. Checking the statistics is a big part of my day, reacting to them when needed.</p>
				<h4>Is it what you expected the role to be?</h4>
				<p>I have been given the freedom to create the role I want it to be. I am able to try new things whilst doing what is also at the core of what a Team Leader is.</p>

				<h4>How do you maintain focus on quality?</h4>
				<p>I constantly update them with stats on how we are doing to make them more involved, I always make sure to provide feedback as soon as there are areas to improve on. I promote success through incentives, it creates a competitive environment which works really well here. I try to base all my incentives on statistics, the goal is always to excel beyond the KPIâ€™s every day.</p>
				<h4>How do you maintain focus on quality?</h4>
				<p>My colleagues, definitely the freedom. I have been given trust and then I learn from there. I am not afraid to make mistakes â€“ everything is calculated to ensure I donâ€™t. I am able to find my way of leading my team.</p>
				<h4>Where do you see yourself in the next few years?</h4>
				<p>I see myself here with Betsson, and I hope to still be with something customer related.</p>

				<h4>Talk me through your career prior to Betsson</h4>

				<p>Itâ€™s the World Cup, and the Football Team has the time of their lives. Daniel Attard is Football Trading Manager with the Sportsbook team. The World Cup, naturally, is a peak time for him and his team of 18 people.</p>
				<p>"It only happens every four years, and it is an opportunity for us to benchmark and show the Betting  World where we stand," Daniel says.</p>

				<p>"We started the preparations about six months ago. It has been, and it still is a lot of hard work."</p>

				<p>Daniels says he is happy that our new product BetBuilder is up and running smoothly. There have been a lot of meetings and cooperation with other parts of the business leading up to the World Cup. With 230 different markets per game, there sure is a lot to keep track of!</p>
				<h4>ENJOY THE RIDE</h4>
				<p>The last week before the World Cup started was a bit nerve-racking, Daniel says, but then the nerves settle down, and everybody started looking forward to it.</p>

				<p>"Now that the World Cup is in full swing we just run with it. My team knows what to do."</p>

				<p>For the Sportsbook team, it's long hours right now. The roster and the shifts have been adjusted to reflect this. During the matches, the live team oversees the odds, making sure we have the best offer and are very competitive. After the last match has ended, there is still work to be done settling the markets and getting ready for the next day.</p>
